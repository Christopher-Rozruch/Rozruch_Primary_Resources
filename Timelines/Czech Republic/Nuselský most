The Nusle Bridge was built between 1967 and 1973. From 1975 to 1989 it was called the Klement Gottwald Bridge. The bridge is 
485 metres long and 26.5m wide. It is made of conrete and iron. It has four pilars. The average height of the bridge is 42m. 
Six lanes of traffic run in two directions on the top of the bridge and the metro runs inside it between the stations I P 
Pavlova and Vyšehrad. 17 houses in the Nusle valley were demolished to make room for the bridge.

At first, the idea was to run underground trams through the bridge. This was changed in 1968 to the idea of running metro 
trains. These were first tested at Kačerov. There were a few problems at first, and the bridge had to be strengthened to take the weight of the metro trains that were bought from the Soviet Union. It is one of the biggest bridged in the Czech Republic.
