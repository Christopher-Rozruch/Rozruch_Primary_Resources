composing at the age of 14. He wrote his first composition for a full orchestra at the age of 18, and his first opera, "Jan 
Zhořelecký" in his student years. He conducted his first theatre orchestra at the National Theatre in 1906. in 1911 he 
conducted his own opera, Poupě.

In 1920 he became the head of opera at the National Theatre.

At first Ostrčil was influenced by Romanticism, for example the work of Gustav Mahler. Later he developed his own style which 
used a lot of dissonance (notes that do not usually sound nice together).
