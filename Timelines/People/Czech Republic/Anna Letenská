child. She got her first acting job in 1919 at the Suková-Kramuelová acting company which her father ran when he came back 
from the war. Before the second world war, she worked in theatres in Olomouc, Bratislava and Kladno. She worked for a time at 
the famous Osvobozené divadlo and worked with Czechoslovenský rozhlas. In 1939 she started working at Vinohradské divadlo 
where she worked until 1942. Here she had some wonderful roles. She won awards for her comic talent. She divorced her first 
husband and married again in 1941. Her second husband, Vladislav Čaloun, was sent to prison for helping the people who killed 
the hated Nazi leader Richard Heydrich. After this, Anna Letenská moved from Divadlo na Vinohradech and started to work for

was sent first to Terezín concetration camp, and then to Mauthausen where she was killed by the Nazis on the 24th October, 
1943. Her husband was killed three months later.
