Born: 28th May, 1883 in Kroměříž
Died: 16th March, 1961 in Beroun

Talich was one of the most important Czech conductors of the 20th Century. Talich came from a very poor family and so his 
violin teacher, Jan Mařák persuaded Antonín Dvořák to meet him. Dvořák then helped him to find money for his studies. Talich 
finished studying in 1903 and became a player in Berlin's Philharmonic orchestra. There he decided to become a conductor. 
Talich became ill with tuberculosis in Berlin and moved to Tbilisi. The politics of Russia went a little but crazy at that 
time, so he came back to Czechoslovakia where he started to conduct, at first amateur musicians, but then the Czech 
Philharmonic orchestra where he would achieve his fame. Too sick with tuberculosis to go to fight in the war, he was out of 
work for a while, but in 1917 he conducted a very successful concert of the compositions of Víteslav Novák, Otakar Ostrčil and 
Antonín Dvořák.

A plaque to Talich is on a house beside the Ruská tram stop on Moskovská in Vršovice.

In 1957 he was named a national artist.
