# Rozruch_Primary_Resources
A Creative Commons repository of primary learning resources

An experimental repository to share teaching resources, ideas, and child-generated content.

The idea is that such a repository could be used in home-schooling, "alternative education", ESoL, and even in mainstream.

Git/GitHub is usually used for software development and for sharing and collaborating on code. I have done some coding, and have taught Python. Unfortunately, however, my latest school frowns upon technology and it is unlikely that I will be working directly with computers in the classroom so long as I am there. I believe strongly that coding teaches kids problem-solving skills and develops mathematical and logical reasoning which must in my view be considered to be one of the manners of thinking which is essential to getting most out of life. I may myself add code here which I will not be able to use myself, but, due to the limitations imposed upon me at the school I am to be working at, that will not at first be my focus.

I am at any rate a writer first and foremost and my recent focus on coding was initially spurred by a writing project. I am a Brit, working in a bilingual school in the Czech Republic, and I hope to use writing to develop my pupil's language (and imaginative, and reasoning) skills from the off.

Git is a wonderful collaborative tool. My experience working with technology with kids is that, often, they are quicker to pick it up than us older folk. Why then, not use Git to share, "fork", adapt and develop writing.

The concept is sketchy at time of writing (3rd August, 2015) and may take a while to pick up, if indeed it does at all.
That said, a single committed contributor, tech-savvy otherwise, could do a lot to kick start it and you have nothing but an hour or two to lose and potentially a great deal to gain from getting involved.

You may notice some unfamiliar file formats used on this project. There is a reason for that. Git handles text files well and other more complicaated file formats (such as word files etc.) very badly. There are other reasons to avoid these formats even elsewhere, but I won't go into open source and freesoftware here. Suffice it to say that I recommend familiarising yourself with the file formats used here: .txt, .md, .html, .rtf at a push (.rtf files are not as Git-friendly as .txt).
