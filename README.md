# Rozruch_Primary_Resources
A Creative Commons repository of primary learning resources

An experimental repository to share teaching resources, ideas, and child-generated content.

The idea is that such a repository could be used (and contributed to) in home-schooling, "alternative education", ESoL, and even in mainstream.

Git/GitHub is usually used for software development and for sharing and collaborating on code. I have done some coding, and 
have taught Python. Unfortunately, however, my latest school frowns upon technology and it is unlikely that I will be working 
directly with computers in the classroom so long as I am there. I believe strongly that coding teaches kids problem-solving 
skills and develops mathematical and logical reasoning which must in my view be considered to be one of the manners of 
thinking which is essential to getting most out of life. I may myself add code here which I will not be able to use myself, but, due to the limitations imposed upon me at the school I am to be working at, that will not at first be my focus.

I am at any rate a writer first and foremost and my recent focus on coding was initially spurred by a writing project. I am a 
Brit, working in a bilingual school in the Czech Republic, and I hope to use writing to develop my pupils' language (and 
imaginative, and reasoning) skills from the off.

Git is a wonderful collaborative tool. My experience working with technology with kids is that, often, they are quicker to 
pick it up than us older folk. Why then, not use Git to share, "fork", adapt and develop writing.

The concept is sketchy at time of writing (3rd August, 2015) and may take a while to pick up, if indeed it does at all.
That said, as with any such project, a single committed contributor, tech-savvy otherwise, could do a lot to kick start it and 
you have nothing but an hour or two to lose and potentially a great deal to gain from getting involved whatever your present 
skillset.

You may notice some (to you) unfamiliar file formats used on this project. There is a reason for that. Git handles text files 
well and other more complicated file formats (such as word files etc.) very badly. There are other reasons to avoid these 
formats even elsewhere, but I won't go into open source and freesoftware here. Suffice it to say that I recommend 
familiarising yourself with the file formats used here: .txt, .md, .html, .rtf at a push (.rtf files are not as Git-friendly 
as .txt).

One last point is that I have a dilemma as to whether to use .html more broadly on this project. Kids (and teachers) can pick 
up .html very quickly in my experience, and it takes 2-3 hours to learn the basics. One good reason *to* use .html would be 
that schools, and even those working in home schooling, could host their own repositories of versions of this one which 
differ in terms of their own content, contributions and the like. A fully, or mostly .html repo could then lead to tens, 
hundreds, thousands, or more subtly or wildly differing versions of stories, of research projects, of coding projects, 
mathematical word problems and the like, could be forked into translated versions etc etc. The possibilities are literally 
endless. In addition, .html versions of pages would enable creative commons pictures and illustrations to be referred to 
without being stored locally, meaning that local repos could be shared and changed easier, and plans could be printed as they 
are without the editing which might be necessitated by the sharing of .txt, .md and pictureless .odt files.

Essentially, nothing is yet set in stone and so I don't want to describe too much here. Get in touch, comment on the github 
pages, and say what you think this project could or should be, or how you could get involved yourself.

Finally, who is Christopher Rozruch? That is at once a simpler, and more complicated question (or at least, one that leads to 
a more convoluted answer). Christopher Rozruch is an alias, a name borrowed (and adapted) from a Czech comic film from 1939. 
The avatar used on the github site meanwhile, is of a pedagogue from another popular Czech film, this time in the early post-revolution years of 1991. If I were you, I wouldn't 
worry your little heads about either of these facts.
