	What Might Rozruch Primary Resources Look Like if Successfull?
	=============================================================

## I suppose I have a few aims for what this may be

*	The open source community is, I suspect, uncommonly intelligent and creative. I do not merely hope to use their
	tools and techniques in order to build a repository of materials which may be used in schools of whatever kind,
	I would also like to encourage them to get involved themselves in order to help to develop the kind of systems[1]
	of education they might have wished to have known themselves. Many in the open source community are essentially
	self-educated, and had very poor experiences of formal education, as I did in many ways myself. It is for this
	reason that I would be interested to see what they might contribute to such a project as this.

*	That Rozruch Primary Resources is one of many branches and that it may have many different flavours and be forked
	into many different languages (perhaps with many such having a common ESoL thread, though its contents may differ
	greatly and though some branches may choose a different, more relevant second language since I am not sure how I
	feel about English taking the default place of a "world language"[2]). That there may be communication between
	these branches and continuous cross-pollination.

	Though I have written about my concerns that the system of education I am working in is de facto Evangelical Christian 
	and indeed in many ways de facto Catholic, and though I do in many ways object to the inculcation of religiosity in
	children, and though I tend to feel this can not but be opposed to scientific principles, it is only right that many 
	of the branches of this project, if it is successful, should be indifferent to this preference and that some will
	develop in both implicitly and explicitly religious ways, whether they be christian or otherwise. My personal 
	philosophical preference is for value pluralism and the recognition of difference, but my personal philosophy is also
	that my personal philosophy ought to be of little concern to anybody who decides to get involved with this project and
	work on it, that if this is to work at all, it should be a great deal more flexible than the alternative systems of
	education currently on offer and that, though some of the materials developed here might be usable within those
	systems and of benefit to them within the confines of their models, they might also enable the development of other
	frameworks.

*	I am a Walter Mitty character. I tilt at windmills. My mind is full of ideas and daydreams sometimes more powerful and
	real to me than the world around me. I have always been this way and likely always will be. I may be seen to be a holy
	fool should I share some of these daydreams, these "reveries", but then, they are a part of who I am and a very large
	part of where my ideas come from, and if this project is to encompass positive notions of neurodiversity as it should,
	there is no reason whatever why I should feel embarrassed about the more peculiar aspects of my thinking and attempt
	to hide them as I could easily do. And so I see no good reason not to share with you one of these Walter Mitty / Billy
	Fisher-style reveries of what such a project could be.
	
	At the time of writing hundreds of thousands of refugees are turning up at the borders of European countries seeking
	refuge from the wars that ravage their countries. Some days ago I had a conversation with a friend of mine in Hamburg
	and she said there had been refugees on a bus from Hannover to Hamburg and she had wanted to hug all her friends. For
	my part I had imagined teaching refugee kids Czech (no, not English) in a little football stadium (Bohemians)[3] near
	me and taking them climbing following a crowd-funding campaign by the team's fans. That was a few days ago now in one 
	of those days at the start of the term that I was feeling sorry for myself for my first world problems of working long 
	hours, meaning that I did not have enough time for my writing and my various hobbies such as climbing and running. 
	Today as I was showering and making breakfast having began the day working on this project, I imagined somebody 
	working with the refugees, in Germany this time, and contributing materials based upon their life story which involved 
	their expressing themselves in their rudimentary English. This then being taken, corrected, with the original staying 
	for reference so that others might learn from it. I imagined contributions involving current events, from the people 
	involved in them. Some written in other languages and translated, others added in rudimentary English. I imagined 
	direct student-created correspondence. I also imagined (in various iterations) explaining the project to the luddite 
	types at my own school. I imagined the explicitly Christian materials on the Earth's origins they keep making out are 
	only provisionally and incidentally Christian by dint of having been written in the 1940s in Italy as if they had not 
	been expressly chosen and reproduced uncorrected in the syllabus over and over again since having been replaced by a 
	crowd-sourced fully-scientific version.

	I guess there are a handful of forms of interaction I am imagining when these reveries go through my mind, and if my
	example above (which I am not certain I have recollected and described accurately from the reverie itself) makes me a
	little uncomfortable in the sense that it involves correcting a kid publicly for the (understandable) errors they make
	in English[4]. I would like to unpack this somewhat. My ideas for such a method of materials sharing and development
	as I am describing here has come about in fact over a number of years and has often involved older and/or more 
	advanced children embellishing and/or correcting work written by younger and/or less advanced students while trying to
	lead them to understand what has changed. Similarly, it has involved these older / more advanced students attempting
	to simplify their work to be understood by those at a lower level, learning how to express themselves more concisely
	and simply.

[1] I will no doubt change this word many times, and would invite others to do the same. I am unhappy with its connotations on 
a philosophical level. I do not wish to be involved in the creation of a _system_ / _systems_ of education.

[2] Many of my friends who do not have English as a first language have no such qualms. For me it can feel imperialistic at 
times that it is assumed that English must be the common language in many international contexts. That the last school I work 
at, an international school in the Czech Republic which runs a dual curriculum, has _banned_ Czech from being spoken from 
staff and students, including by Czech teachers, that is, teachers of the Czech language and those who deliver lessons in the 
Czech language on the Czech syllabus, only underscores this concern.

[3] The Czechs can be very racist and anti-immigration as a rule but Bohemians fans are notably anti-racist and this may be 
one of the few places in the Czech republic it could be possible to imagine such a thing happening.

[4] In fact I have fewer qualms about pointing out mistakes than most of the people who work in the system of education I am 
currently working in. I am of the opinion that making mistakes is absolutely normal and is an essential part of learning, and 
that refusing to point out mistakes can make a taboo of them which is far from helpful. My experience is that working on and 
working with mistakes is essential in maths and second language acquisition and very useful elsewhere. There are progressive 
systems of education which I respect, such as the Hejn√Ω method, in which teachers are discouraged from correcting mistakes, 
but there is nevertheless a system whereby children can come to understand that they have made mistakes by peer correction. 
Other systems which make a sin of correction can be damaging and doctrinaire, and can lead to serious difficulties for 
children in later life. The problems of such doctrines when they are used to teach the baroque grammar of Czech are, 
alas, manifest, but there are problems too with the English language.
